## Error Handling and Validation
Ensure to add proper error handling and validation in your components to improve user experience and security. Validate user inputs on the client side to prevent incorrect or malicious data from being submitted to the server. Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and edge cases, providing clear feedback to users when something goes wrong. This includes validating user inputs, handling network errors, and displaying informative error messages.

## Security Rules
Set up security rules for Firebase services like Firestore and Storage to control access to your data and resources. Firebase Security Rules allow you to define who has read and write access to your data, and under what conditions. Ensure that your security rules are properly configured to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access or modification. Regularly review and update your security rules as your application evolves to maintain a secure environment for your users' data.
